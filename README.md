## Overview
This project was developed as part of my developer portfolio to showcase problem-solving, JavaScript, and user interface design skills. The project incorporates functionality such as modal dialog boxes, displayDate, intro welcome messages, and content blur effectsâ€”originally created as part of an earlier crossword puzzle project (feel free to ask me about that!).

                                    ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡Lessons Learned ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

 I learned A LOT through this experience. The journey reinforced that done is better than perfect. It showed me the value of project management, foundational development, and iterative problem-solving.

Starting with Foundations ðŸ“šðŸ“š

* I initially jumped straight into JavaScript logic without focusing on the foundational HTML and CSS. This experience taught me the importance of having a strong base before building on itâ€”You canâ€™t decorate a house without first building its foundation.

Trial, Error, Debugging, and Problem-Solving ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

* Through trial and error, I developed two critical skills: debugging and problem-solving. Development isnâ€™t just about memorization; itâ€™s about actively engaging with problems. Writing a flowchart significantly improved my critical thinking and allowed me to approach problems methodically. This has already improved how I search for solutions when coding.

New Skills Learned ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“

This project taught me concepts and skills that independent study outside of coding bootcamp can teach you, such as:

* Working with character entities

* Using onclick functions effectively

* Creating and implementing a dropdown menu that includes modal dialog boxes

* Creating a dynamic timer that pauses, resets, and starts

Although I didnâ€™t finish the crossword logic or fully implement out the Sudoku game, the knowledge and skills gained from this project have fundamentally changed the way I will approach future projects.

                              Key Takeaways, or TL;DR

* Developed problem-solving strategies using flowcharts and iterative debugging

* Learned foundational JS skills and new practical features, like modal dialog boxes, timers, and dynamic event handling

* Improved my ability to map logical workflows from concept to execution

* Improved my CSS skills by making the grid responsive to tablet and desktop screens

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I'm Proud Of

You can add code snippets using the syntax:

```js
function closeBlurb() {
    document.getElementById("sud-section").style.display = "none";
    document.querySelector(".content-to-blur").style.filter = "none";
    document.querySelector(".content-to-blur").style.webkitFilter = "none";
};
```
```js
const modal = document.getElementById("howToPlay");
const icon = document.getElementById("howToPlayIcon");
const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

icon.onclick = function () {
    modal.style.display = "block";
};

closeBtn.onclick = function () {
    modal.style.display = "none";
};
```
```js
function displayDate() {
    const now = new Date();
    const format = { weekday: 'long', month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' };
    const currentDayDate = now.toLocaleString('en-US', format);
    document.getElementById("date").textContent = currentDayDate;
}
displayDate();
```

### Boilerplate

- [Piccalil CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - My go-to CSS Reset tool
- [Dinson Kadudhus](https://responsivetesttool.com/) - Website Responsive Testing

### Useful Sites

- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-sudoku-puzzle-using-html-css-javascript/) - Provided the JavaScript logic and puzzle regeneration mechanics for the Sudoku game. I focused on showcasing how I customized these features using JavaScript.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)- A go-to resource for troubleshooting code-related questions. Itâ€™s incredibly reassuring to know that countless others have faced similar challenges, making problem-solving feel less isolating.

- [mdn-web_docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)- A fantastic resource with clear explanations and visual examples. MDN has been invaluable for understanding web development concepts and honing my skills through hands-on learning.

- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)-  I adapted and customized their examples for my own projects, and their clear explanations made the learning process much smoother.

## AI prompt

- OpenAI - [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) - I used ChatGPT as an AI companion to create a personal Q&A framework. This helped me better understand the new concepts I encountered while building this project. The prompt I used to guide the discussion was:

```Ok, I tried to google this answer and got a multitude of solutions. How do I learn what to google? I don't want to copy and paste. I want to learn the fundamentals behind it. Like, what articles do I need to read to come to the answer you did?```

This process helped me deepen my understanding and learn to independently explore related topics effectively.
